# Shift, Sink, and Shatter
---
A piece for concert band

The idea here is to go all out with these intervallic ideas and trying to work on this new music composing process:

### Composing Process
We are trying this idea of *mastering the ideas*, where we are trying to find as many as is useful transformations of idea A through K that have already been written down. Then after that development process there will be a recombination of the developments of ideas A-K and we will consider that to be a truly developed set of ideas. Once that is done we can begin structuring those ideas in the way that seems natural based on the concepts we already have in-place for the piece.

### Concept for the piece
- Basically an inversion of Daphnis et Chloe from a musical perspective where we go from Dark to Light and we want to use the three metaphors we have in the title to do interesting things.
- We are developing this *concept of intervallic* engines that are driving more typical harmonic material. What is it that makes certain harmonic effects so effective? Can we take that and figure out some of the underlying intervallic logic that makes it work and do something interesting with that?
- I want to take these two jazz comping books I have and see if I can find some cool intervallic things that will work in the concert band concept.
- The idea of shift is most important to what we will do with stable things becoming less stable and etc.
- The second two metaphors, sink and shatter, are more link tone promises and they kind of imply this three part form.
- I want to get some of the twelve-tone stuff into there as well.
- Also want to use *harmonic major* and *double harmonic major* and the *whole tone plus P4 and M7*. And *Double Harmonic Minor*.
