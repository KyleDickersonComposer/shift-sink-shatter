A Rondo-Variations for Concert Band

### Composing Process
- The idea is to try to shift my intention from writing over-wrought music into a approach of radical simplicity and effectiveness.
- When you think about it what has happened to me is the same thing that happens to english majors where they lose the ability to write in their own voice.
- When you think about what jblow did when he had problems finishing things is he simplified the things he was trying to do drastically. (Simplify as many parameters as you can to try and get something done)
- The opportunity to think through my process 50 times in a row every week will be very important in terms of development.
- My theoretical development was essential for my teaching practice but not necessarily for the composing process.

### Writing Process
1. For each labeled idea develop the ideas to one page in length to get a feel for their capabilities.
1. After developing all of the ideas, create formal plan with timings and annotations.
1. Create the short score in the copmuter and move to a blank band score to orchestrate.
1. Orchestrate that then input the orchestation into the computer for the first draft.
1. Go through a few more drafts.
1. Go through the engraving process, add cues and parts.
1. Create a good mockup, might have to put it into Musescore.
1. Finish the front matter and polishing, then upload to MyScore.
