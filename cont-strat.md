1. YouTube video on dissonance.
1. Getting a basic course that demonstrates all of LMS features.
1. Getting a Few Pieces on MyScore and for the website redesign.
1. Thinking about social media outreach? Twitter/Youtube (Also, just emailing people?)

When you look at this thing structurally the problems in my way have been mostly the technical side of things and not writing enough music and not finishing music.

It seems that I have the technical stuff I need for the next major phase complete. Now we need to solve my music problems and get a few pieces together and out there on MyScore that way we can start making progress with my general content production strategy.

Reaching people through youtube seems like the most promising way to get to people. Also, there may be people who watch a stream and will be interested? The stream is probably a better way to show what I'm doing than doing pure outreach though.

Streaming is about showing people what I do and maybe you may reach a few people who are interested and that could be a way to get students.

When the technical foundation of the website is settled we can work in that way and build the teaching materials on stream.

Want to email Thomas Echols as well see what responses he got to that message asking for interns?
